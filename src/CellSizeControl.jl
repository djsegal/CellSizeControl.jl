    CellSizeControl

Generic cell-size-control primitives: the sizer / adder / timer rules, the
model-agnostic **slope discriminator** (Soifer, Robert & Amir 2016 — `Vd` vs `Vb`
slope: timer→2, adder→1, sizer→0), and the budding-yeast **inhibitor-dilution
sizer** (Schmoller, Turner, Kõivomägi & Skotheim 2015: Start at `V* = W/[Whi5]*`).

Spun out of the yeast-wcm workshop (the cell-size-control module — Track-A class
artifact + Track-B package). Self-contained (no domain deps): the size-control
question — *what rule keeps a dividing population's size distribution stable?* —
is generic. See `docs/THREE_LAYER.md` for the analytic/reference/cross-source
testing and `../../docs/literature/AUDIT_NOTES.md` §4 for the source grounding.

proteostasis begets more damage; Lindner 2008, Hughes & Gottschling 2012) — and the mother

mother senesces when her retained damage `D` crosses her viability threshold; the returned

lifespan is finite.

grow `Vb → V*`, zero for a mother already ≥ V*) plus a fixed **Cln2 timer** step `T_cln2`

G1 ≈ `T_cln2`, while a daughter (born small) spends extra time reaching V* — the
mother/daughter G1 asymmetry EMERGES, it is not imposed. Returns the phase + size readout.
